WebPriceScraper
==========

Quick description:<br>
Scrapes Amazon for cheapest item and provides SMS/email alert.<br>

Details:<br>
-Main operation:<br>
Program scrapes websites for lowest price. Properties are defined in "ScrapeDirector.java" If item is not the lowest the program will wait for a period of time and refresh the page. This activity will continue indefinitely until an item becomes available with a price equal or lower than the price the user set the parameter to.<br>
-Upon lower priced item listing:<br>
When the item becomes available at or less than the desired value the program will send a SMS and email alert with the defined product name, price, user feedback, condition, and description. After finding a cheaper item, the program will set the lowest price to the price of the lowest priced item - 1 cent and continue to loop for cheaper items that may be listed.<br>

Includes user configurable parameters in ScrapeDirector:<br>

**variable type in brackets is to be replaced with corresponding values.

		Thread parameters include:<br>
			.setProductName("[string]") //Item description to be provided in SMS/email notification<br>
			.setHomePage("[string]") //URL link on Amazon<br>
			.setPhoneNumber("[int]") //Phone number to send notification<br>
			.setEmail("[string]") //Email to send notification<br>
			.setPrice("[int]") //Highest desired price<br>
			.setRefreshRate("[int]") //Refresh page rate (in seconds)<br>

Note:<br>
-Parameters are optional, but, obviously, if the homepage, price, refreshrate are not set the program will produce unexpected results.<br>
-Program runs multi-threaded instances of RunThread so many different items can be watched and parameters can be set.<br>

v2.0
-------------------
Updates:

Migrated all user-programmable data into "ScrapeDirector.java". Including private data for Twillio.
Director now utilizes a nested builder class for optionally determining scrape parameters.
Utilized factory class for handling multiple websites. Website is parased and corresponding object is created for each scrape.

Note: Only Amazon scraper works properly.
